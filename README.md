Mine Sweeper was the first mini project that I did in my first semester of university with c language and one of the first projects that I coded.
It is a simple mine sweeper game that can be played in the terminal. Open the .exe file in the project folder and play it in 8x8 or 16x16 mode.
Note that a valid move in the game is like this: "3 6 L".
